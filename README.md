This repo can be used for modeling the noise from a TDM readout system.  To model the noise, you use the full_system_noise function from s4_readout_noise.py, providing a configuration file for the system being modeled as well as a list containing the noise terms to be included.  If the sample_tag is full_bandwidth it will return the full noise, while if it is multiplexing it will use aliased_noise to downsample to the appropriate rate.  To compare the results to measurement, it is useful to take 50 MHz noise traces - instructions on how to do that with the MCE are in a txt file here.
